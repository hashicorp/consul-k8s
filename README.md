# Consul + Kubernetes

This project is an official source of first-class integrations of Consul
with Kubernetes. The tools in this repository can be used for multiple
use cases from running Consul on Kubernetes to syncing services or
automatically enabling [Connect](https://www.consul.io/docs/connect/index.html).

The Kubernetes integrations with Consul are
[documented directly on the Consul website](https://www.consul.io/docs/kubernetes/index.html).
This README will present a basic overview of each use case, but for full
documentation please reference the Consul website.
