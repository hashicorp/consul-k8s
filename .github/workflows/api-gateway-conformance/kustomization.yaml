# Consul API Gateway.

apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

resources:
  - ./base/manifests.yaml
  - ./proxydefaults.yaml

patches:
  # Add connect-inject annotation to each Deployment. This is required due to
  # containerPort not being defined on Deployments upstream. Though containerPort
  # is optional, Consul relies on it as a default value in the absence of a
  # connect-service-port annotation.

  # We don't have enough resources in the GitHub-hosted Actions runner to support 2 replicas
