# This job deletes the partition-init job once it completes successfully.
# It runs as a helm hook because it only needs to run when the partition-init
# Job gets recreated which only happens during an install or upgrade.
# We also utilize the helm hook-delete-policy to delete this job itself.
# We want to delete the partition-init job because once it runs successfully
# it's not needed and also because if it stays around then when users run
# helm upgrade with values that change the spec of the job, Kubernetes errors
# because the job spec is immutable. If the job is deleted, then a new job
# is created and there's no error.
