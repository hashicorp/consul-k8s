Thank you for installing HashiCorp Consul!

Now that you have deployed Consul, you should look over the docs on using 
Consul with Kubernetes available here: 

https://www.consul.io/docs/platform/k8s/index.html


Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}.

To learn more about the release, run:

  $ helm status {{ .Release.Name }}
  $ helm get all {{ .Release.Name }}


{{- if (and .Values.global.acls.manageSystemACLs (gt (len .Values.server.extraConfig) 3)) }}
Warning: Defining server extraConfig potentially disrupts the automatic ACL
         bootstrapping required settings. This may cause future issues if
         there are conflicts.
{{- end }}
