                        BackendRefs defines the backend(s) where matching requests should be sent.


                        Failure behavior here depends on how many BackendRefs are specified and
                        how many are invalid.


                        If all entries in BackendRefs are invalid, and there are also no filters
                        specified in this route rule, all traffic which matches this rule MUST
                        receive a 500 status code.


                        See the HTTPBackendRef definition for the rules about what makes a single
                        HTTPBackendRef invalid.


                        When a HTTPBackendRef is invalid, 500 status codes MUST be returned for
                        requests that would have otherwise been routed to an invalid backend. If
                        multiple backends are specified, and some are invalid, the proportion of
                        requests that would otherwise have been routed to an invalid backend MUST
                        receive a 500 status code.


                        For example, if two backends are specified with equal weights, and one is
                        invalid, 50 percent of traffic must receive a 500. Implementations may
                        choose how that 50 percent is determined.

                                    If a query param is repeated in an HTTP request, the behavior is purposely
                                    left undefined, since different data planes have different capabilities.
                                    However, it is recommended that implementations should match against the
                                    first value of the param if the data plane supports it, as this behavior
                                    is expected in other load balancing contexts outside of the Gateway API.


                                    Users SHOULD NOT route traffic based on repeated query params to guard
                                    themselves against potential differences in the implementations.
