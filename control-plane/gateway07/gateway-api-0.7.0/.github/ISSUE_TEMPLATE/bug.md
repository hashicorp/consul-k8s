<!--
Thank you for your interest in Gateway API! Please note that bug reports 
here should only be used for bugs with the API itself, such as:

- Incomplete or inaccurate validation
- Problems with the API specification
- Unexpected errors with the validating webhook
- Flaws in conformance tests

Bugs that don't fit into one of the above categories should likely be filed
with the [implementation](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/)
of Gateway API that you're using.

Please use this template while reporting a bug and provide as much info as
possible. Not doing so may result in your bug not being addressed in a timely
manner. Thank you!
