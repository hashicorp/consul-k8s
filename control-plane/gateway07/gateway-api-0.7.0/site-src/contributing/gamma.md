# The GAMMA Initiative

The GAMMA (Gateway API for Mesh Management and Administration) initiative is a
dedicated workstream within the Gateway API subproject. This groupâ€™s goal is to
investigate, design, and track Gateway API resources, semantics, and other
artifacts related to service mesh technology and use-cases. Additionally, we
strive to advocate for consistency between implementations of the Gateway API by
service mesh projects, regardless of their technology stack or proxy.

## Deliverables

This group will deliver [Gateway Enhancement Proposals](/geps/overview)
consisting of resources, additions, and modifications to the Gateway API
specification for mesh and mesh-adjacent use-cases. Governance of the Gateway
API specification remains solely with the maintainers of the Gateway API
subproject. Ideally, once service mesh use-cases become a first-party concern of
the spec, there will be no further need for a separate initiative.

## Meeting mechanics

GAMMA meetings will occur weekly on Tuesdays for 1 hour, alternating between 3pm
PT and 8am PT slots to try to be as time-zone inclusive as possible. Meetings
will be moderated by the [GAMMA
leads](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/OWNERS_ALIASES#L23)
with notes taken by a volunteer. Meeting occurrences can be found on the
[sig-network calendar](/contributing/community/#meetings). Community members
should feel free to attend both GAMMA and Gateway API meetings, but are by no
means obligated to do so.
