                        BackendRefs defines the backend(s) where matching requests should be sent.
                        Failure behavior here depends on how many BackendRefs are specified and
                        how many are invalid.


                        If all entries in BackendRefs are invalid, and there are also no filters
                        specified in this route rule, all traffic which matches this rule MUST
                        receive a 500 status code.


                        See the GRPCBackendRef definition for the rules about what makes a single
                        GRPCBackendRef invalid.


                        When a GRPCBackendRef is invalid, 500 status codes MUST be returned for
                        requests that would have otherwise been routed to an invalid backend. If
                        multiple backends are specified, and some are invalid, the proportion of
                        requests that would otherwise have been routed to an invalid backend MUST
                        receive a 500 status code.


                        For example, if two backends are specified with equal weights, and one is
                        invalid, 50 percent of traffic must receive a 500. Implementations may
                        choose how that 50 percent is determined.
