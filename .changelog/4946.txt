```release-note:enhancement
api-gateway: Add support for file-based Envoy access log sinks via proxy-defaults. Previously, only stdout logging was supported.
connect-inject: When proxy-defaults enables file-based access logs, automatically inject an emptyDir volume and volumeMount into the consul-dataplane container.
