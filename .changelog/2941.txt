```release-note:feature
:tada: This release provides the ability to preview Consul's v2 Catalog and Resource API if enabled.
The new model supports multi-port application deployments with only a single Envoy proxy.
Note that the v1 and v2 catalogs are not cross compatible, and not all Consul features are available within this v2 feature preview.
See the [v2 Catalog and Resource API documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/k8s/multiport) for more information.
The v2 Catalog and Resources API should be considered a feature preview within this release and should not be used in production environments.

### Limitations
* The v1 and v2 catalog APIs cannot run concurrently.
* The Consul UI must be disable. It does not support multi-port services or the v2 catalog API in this release.
* HCP Consul does not support multi-port services or the v2 catalog API in this release.
* The v2 API only supports transparent proxy mode where services that have permissions to connect to each other can use
  Kube DNS to connect.

### Known Issues
* When using the v2 API with transparent proxy, Kubernetes pods cannot use L7 liveness, readiness, or startup probes.
