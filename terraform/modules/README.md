# Terraform Modules

This directory contains reusable [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) modules
for various tasks related to Consul and Kubernetes, from spinning up a demo
cluster to running tests.

These modules are used by our own automated systems for verifying the
functionality of the Consul and Kubernetes components. These modules aren't
meant to be production-ready deployment modules.
