## UNRELEASED

## 0.10.0 (December 17, 2019)

Bug Fixes:

* Connect: Fix critical bug where Connect-registered services instances would be deregistered
  when the Consul client on the same node was restarted. This fix adds a new
  sidecar that ensures the service instance is always registered. [[GH-161](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/161)]  
  
* Connect: Fix bug where UI links between sidecar and service didn't work because
  the wrong service ID was being used. [[GH-163](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/163)]  
  
* Bootstrap ACLs: Support bootstrapACLs for users setting the `nameOverride` config. [[GH-165](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/165)]  

## 0.9.5 (December 5, 2019)

Bug Fixes:

* Sync: Add Kubernetes namespace as a suffix
  to the service names via `-add-k8s-namespace-suffix` flag.
  This prevents service name collisions in Consul when there
  are two services with the same name in different
  namespaces in Kubernetes [[GH-139](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/139)]
  
* Connect: Only write a `service-defaults` config during Connect injection if
  the protocol is set explicitly [[GH-169](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/169)]  

## 0.9.4 (October 28, 2019)

Bug Fixes:

* Sync: Now changing the annotation `consul.hashicorp.com/service-sync` to `false`
  or deleting the annotation will un-sync the service. [[GH-76](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/76)]

* Sync: Rewrite Consul services to lowercase so they're valid Kubernetes services.
  [[GH-110](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/110)]

## 0.9.3 (October 15, 2019)

Bug Fixes:

* Add new delete-completed-job command that is used to delete the
  server-acl-init Kubernetes Job once it's completed. [[GH-152](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/152)]

* Fixes a bug where even if the ACL Tokens for the other components existed
  (e.g. client or sync-catalog) we'd try to generate new tokens and update the secrets. [[GH-152](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/152)]

## 0.9.2 (October 4, 2019)

Improvements:

* Allow users to set annotations on their Kubernetes services that get synced into
  Consul meta when using the Connect Inject functionality.
  To use, set one or more `consul.hashicorp.com/service-meta-<key>: <value>` annotations
  which will result in Consul meta `<key>: <value>`
  [[GH-141](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/141)]

Bug Fixes:

* Fix bug during connect-inject where the `-default-protocol` flag was being
  ignored [[GH-141](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/141)]

* Fix bug during connect-inject where service-tag annotations were
  being ignored [[GH-141](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/141)]

* Fix bug during `server-acl-init` where if any step errored then the command
  would exit and subsequent commands would fail. Now this command runs until
  completion, i.e. it retries failed steps indefinitely and is idempotent
  [[GH-138](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/138)]

Deprecations:

* The `consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-tags` annotation is deprecated.
  Use `consul.hashicorp.com/service-tags` instead.

## 0.9.1 (September 18, 2019)

Improvements:

* Allow users to set tags on their Kubernetes services that get synced into
  Consul service tags via the `consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-tags`
  annotation [[GH-115](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/115)]

Bug fixes:

* Fix bootstrap acl issue when Consul was installed into a namespace other than `default`
  [[GH-106](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/106)]
* Fix sync bug where `ClusterIP` services had their `Service` port instead
  of their `Endpoint` port registered. If the `Service`'s `targetPort` was different
  then `port` then the wrong port would be registered [[GH-132](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/132)]

Bug fixes:

* Fix central configuration write command to handle the case where the service already exists

## 0.8.0 (May 8, 2019)

* Support automatic bootstrapping of ACLs in a Consul cluster that is run fully in Kubernetes.

Bug fixes:

* Fix service registration naming when using Connect [[GH 36](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/36)]
* Fix catalog sync so that agents don't incorrectly deregister Kubernetes services [[GH 40](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/40)][[GH 59](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/59)]
* Fix performance issue for the k8s -> Consul catalog sync [[GH 60](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/60)]

* Add the metadata/annotations field if needed before patching annotations [[GH 20](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/20)]
