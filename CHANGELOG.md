## UNRELEASED

BREAKING CHANGES
* Connect: the `lifecycle-sidecar` command has been renamed to `consul-sidecar`. [[GH-428](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/428)]
* Connect: the `consul-connect-lifecycle-sidecar` container name has been changed to `consul-sidecar` and the `consul-connect-envoy-sidecar` container name has been changed to `envoy-sidecar`. 
[[GH-428](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/428)]
* Connect: the `-default-protocol` and `-enable-central-config` flags are no longer supported.
  The `consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-protocol` annotation on Connect pods is also
  no longer supported. [[GH-418](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/418)]

  Current deployments that have the annotation should remove it, otherwise they
  will get an error if a pod from that deployment is rescheduled.

  Removing the annotation will not change their protocol
  since the config entry was already written to Consul. If you wish to change
  the protocol you must migrate the config entry to be managed by a
  [`ServiceDefaults`](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/config-entries/service-defaults) resource.
  See [Upgrade to CRDs](https://www.consul.io/docs/k8s/crds/upgrade-to-crds) for more
  information.

  To set the protocol for __new__ services, you must use the
  [`ServiceDefaults`](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/config-entries/service-defaults) resource,
  e.g.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
  kind: ServiceDefaults
  metadata:
    name: my-service-name
  spec:
    protocol: "http"
  ```
* Connect: pods using an upstream that references a datacenter, e.g.
  `consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-upstreams: service:8080:dc2` will
  error during injection if Consul does not have a `proxy-defaults` config entry
  with a [mesh gateway mode](https://www.consul.io/docs/connect/config-entries/proxy-defaults#mode)
  set to `local` or `remote`. [[GH-421](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/421)]

  In practice, this would have already been causing issues since without that
  config setting, traffic wouldn't have been routed through mesh gateways and
  so would not be actually making it to the other service.

FEATURES:
* CRDs: support annotation `consul.hashicorp.com/migrate-entry` on custom resources
  that will allow an existing config entry to be migrated onto a Kubernetes custom resource. [[GH-419](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/419)]
* Connect: add new cleanup controller that runs in the connect-inject deployment. This
  controller cleans up Consul service instances that remain registered despite their
  pods being deleted. This could happen if the pod's `preStop` hook failed to execute
  for some reason. [[GH-433](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/433)]

IMPROVEMENTS:
* CRDs: give a more descriptive error when a config entry already exists in Consul. [[GH-420](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/420)]
* Set `User-Agent: consul-k8s/<version>` header on calls to Consul where `<version>` is the current
  version of `consul-k8s`. [[GH-434](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/434)]

## 0.23.0 (January 22, 2021)

BUG FIXES:
* CRDs: Fix issue where a `ServiceIntentions` resource could be continually resynced with Consul
  because Consul's internal representation had a different order for an array than the Kubernetes resource. [[GH-416](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/416)] 
* CRDs: **(Consul Enterprise only)** default the `namespace` fields on resources where Consul performs namespace defaulting to prevent constant re-syncing.
  [[GH-413](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/413)]

IMPROVEMENTS:
* ACLs: give better error if policy that consul-k8s tries to update was created manually by user. [[GH-412](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/412)]

FEATURES:
* TLS: add `tls-init` command that is responsible for creating and updating Server TLS certificates. [[GH-410](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/410)]

## 0.22.0 (December 21, 2020)

BUG FIXES:
* Connect: on termination of a connect injected pod the lifecycle-sidecar sometimes re-registered the application resulting in
  stale service entries for applications which no longer existed. [[GH-409](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/409)]

BREAKING CHANGES:
* Connect: the flags `-envoy-image` and `-consul-image` for command `inject-connect` are now required. [[GH-405](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/405)]

FEATURES:
* CRDs: add new CRD `IngressGateway` for configuring Consul's [ingress-gateway](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/config-entries/ingress-gateway) config entry. [[GH-407](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/407)]
* CRDs: add new CRD `TerminatingGateway` for configuring Consul's [terminating-gateway](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/config-entries/terminating-gateway) config entry. [[GH-408](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/408)]

## 0.21.0 (November 25, 2020)

IMPROVEMENTS:
* Connect: Add `-log-level` flag to `inject-connect` command. [[GH-400](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/400)]
* Connect: Ensure `consul-connect-lifecycle-sidecar` container shuts down gracefully upon receiving `SIGTERM`. [[GH-389](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/389)]
* Connect: **(Consul Enterprise only)** give more descriptive error message if using Consul namespaces with a Consul installation that doesn't support namespaces. [[GH-399](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/399)]

## 0.20.0 (November 12, 2020)

FEATURES:
* Connect: Support Kubernetes health probe synchronization with Consul for connect injected pods. [[GH-363](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/363)]
    * Adds a new controller to the connect-inject webhook which is responsible for synchronizing Kubernetes pod health checks with Consul service instance health checks.
      A Consul health check is registered for each connect-injected pod which mirrors the pod's Readiness status to Consul. This modifies connect routing to only
      pods which have passing Kubernetes health checks. See breaking changes for more information.
    * Adds a new label to connect-injected pods which mirrors the `consul.hashicorp.com/connect-inject-status` annotation.
    * **(Consul Enterprise only)** Adds a new annotation to connect-injected pods when namespaces are enabled: `consul.hashicorp.com/consul-namespace`. [[GH-376](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/376)]

BREAKING CHANGES:
* Connect: With the addition of the connect-inject health checks controller any connect services which have failing Kubernetes readiness
  probes will no longer be routable through connect until their Kubernetes health probes are passing.
  Previously, if any connect services were failing their Kubernetes readiness checks they were still routable through connect.
  Users should verify that their connect services are passing Kubernetes readiness probes prior to using health checks synchronization.

DEPRECATIONS:
* `create-inject-token` in the server-acl-init command has been un-deprecated.
  `-create-inject-auth-method` has been deprecated and replaced by `-create-inject-token`.
  
  `-create-inject-namespace-token` in the server-acl-init command has been deprecated. Please use `-create-inject-token` and `-enable-namespaces` flags
  to achieve the same functionality. [[GH-368](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/368)]

IMPROVEMENTS:
* Connect: support passing extra arguments to the envoy binary. [[GH-378](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/378)]
    
    Arguments can be passed in 2 ways:
    * via a flag to the consul-k8s inject-connect command,
      e.g. `consul-k8s inject-connect -envoy-extra-args="--log-level debug --disable-hot-restart"`
    * via pod annotations,
      e.g. `consul.hashicorp.com/envoy-extra-args: "--log-level debug --disable-hot-restart"`
      
* CRDs:
   * Add Age column to CRDs. [[GH-365](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/365)]
   * Add validations and field descriptions for ServiceIntentions CRD. [[GH-385](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/385)]
   * Update CRD sync status if deletion in Consul fails. [[GH-365](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/365)]

BUG FIXES:
* Federation: **(Consul Enterprise only)** ensure replication ACL token can replicate policies and tokens in Consul namespaces other than `default`. [[GH-364](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/364)]
* CRDs: **(Consul Enterprise only)** validate custom resources can only set namespace fields if Consul namespaces are enabled. [[GH-375](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/375)]
* CRDs: Ensure ACL token is global so that secondary DCs can manage custom resources.
  Without this fix, controllers running in secondary datacenters would get ACL errors. [[GH-369](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/369)]
* CRDs: **(Consul Enterprise only)** Do not attempt to create a `*` namespace when service intentions specify `*` as `destination.namespace`. [[GH-382](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/382)]
* CRDs: **(Consul Enterprise only)** Fix namespace support for ServiceIntentions CRD. [[GH-362](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/362)]
* CRDs: Rename field namespaces -> namespace in ServiceResolver CRD. [[GH-365](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/365)]

## 0.19.0 (October 12, 2020)

FEATURES:
* Add beta support for new commands `consul-k8s controller` and `consul-k8s webhook-cert-manager`. [[GH-353](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/353)]

  `controller` will start a Kubernetes controller that acts on Consul
  Custom Resource Definitions. The currently supported CRDs are:
    * `ProxyDefaults` - https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/config-entries/proxy-defaults
    * `ServiceDefaults` - https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/config-entries/service-defaults
    * `ServiceSplitter` - https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/config-entries/service-splitter
    * `ServiceRouter` - https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/config-entries/service-router
    * `ServiceResolver` - https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/config-entries/service-resolver
    * `ServiceIntentions` (requires Consul >= 1.9.0) - https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/config-entries/service-intentions
   
   See [https://www.consul.io/docs/k8s/crds](https://www.consul.io/docs/k8s/crds)
   for more information on the CRD schemas. **Requires Consul >= 1.8.4**.
   
   `webhook-cert-manager` manages certificates for Kubernetes webhooks. It will
   refresh expiring certificates and update corresponding secrets and mutating
   webhook configurations.

BREAKING CHANGES:
* Connect: No longer set `--max-obj-name-len` flag when executing `envoy`. This flag
  was [deprecated](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/version_history/v1.11.0#deprecated)
  in Envoy 1.11.0 and had no effect from then onwards. With Envoy >= 1.15.0 setting
  this flag will result in an error, hence why we're removing it. [[GH-350](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/350)]

  If you are running any Envoy version >= 1.11.0 this change will have no effect. If you
  are running an Envoy version < 1.11.0 then you must upgrade Envoy to a newer
  version. This can be done by setting the `global.imageEnvoy` key in the
  Consul Helm chart.

IMPROVEMENTS:

* Add an ability to configure the synthetic Consul node name where catalog sync registers services. [[GH-312](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/312)]
  * Sync: Add `-consul-node-name` flag to the `sync-catalog` command to configure the Consul node name for syncing services to Consul.
  * ACLs: Add `-sync-consul-node-name` flag to the server-acl-init command so that it can create correct policy for the sync catalog.

BUG FIXES:
* Connect: use the first secret of type `kubernetes.io/service-account-token` when creating/updating auth method. [[GH-350](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/321)]
  
## 0.18.1 (August 10, 2020)

BUG FIXES:

* Connect: Reduce downtime caused by an alias health check of the sidecar proxy not being healthy for up to 1 minute
  when a Connect-enabled service is restarted. Note that this fix reverts the behavior of Consul Connect to the behavior
  it had before consul-k8s `v0.16.0` and Consul `v1.8.x`, where Consul can route to potentially unhealthy instances of a service
  because we don't respect Kubernetes readiness/liveness checks yet. Please follow [GH-155](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/155)
  for updates on that feature. [[GH-305](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/305)]

## 0.18.0 (July 30, 2020)

IMPROVEMENTS:

* Connect: Add resource request and limit flags for the injected init and lifecycle sidecar containers. These flags replace the hardcoded values previously included. As part of this change, the default value for the lifecycle sidecar container memory limit has increased from `25Mi` to `50Mi`. [[GH-298](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/298)], [[GH-300](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/300)]

BUG FIXES:

* Connect: Respect allow/deny list flags when namespaces are disabled. [[GH-296](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/296)]

## 0.17.0 (July 09, 2020)

BREAKING CHANGES:

* ACLs: Always update Kubernetes auth method created by the `server-acl-init` job. Previously, we would only update the auth method if Consul namespaces are enabled. With this change, we always update it to make sure that any configuration changes or updates to the `connect-injector-authmethod-svc-account` are propagated [[GH-282](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/282)].
* Connect: Connect pods have had the following resource settings changed: `consul-connect-inject-init` now has its memory limit set to `150M` up from `25M` and `consul-connect-lifecycle-sidecar` has its CPU request and limit set to `20m` up from `10m`. [[GH-291](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/291)]

IMPROVEMENTS:

* Extracted Consul's HTTP flags into our own package so we no longer depend on the internal Consul golang module. [[GH-259](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/259)]

BUG FIXES:

* Connect: Update resource settings to fix out of memory errors and CPU usage at 100% of limit. [[GH-283](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/283), [consul-helm GH-515](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-helm/issues/515)]
* Connect: Creating a pod with a different service account name than its Consul service name will now result in an error when ACLs are enabled.
  Previously this would not result in an error, but the pod would not be able to send or receive traffic because its ACL token would be for a
  different service name. [[GH-237](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/237)]

## 0.16.0 (June 17, 2020)

FEATURES:

* ACLs: `server-acl-init` now supports creating tokens for ingress and terminating gateways [[GH-264](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/264)].
  * Add `-ingress-gateway-name` flag that takes the name of an ingress gateway that needs an acl token. May be specified multiple times. [Enterprise Only] If using Consul namespaces and registering the gateway outside of the default namespace, specify the value in the form `<GatewayName>.<ConsulNamespace>`.
  * Add `-terminating-gateway-name` flag that takes the name of a terminating gateway that needs an acl token. May be specified multiple times. [Enterprise Only] If using Consul namespaces and registering the gateway outside of the default namespace, specify the value in the form `<GatewayName>.<ConsulNamespace>`.
* Connect: Add support for configuring resource settings for memory and cpu limits/requests for sidecar proxies. [[GH-267](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/267)]

BREAKING CHANGES:

* Gateways: `service-address` command will now return hostnames if that is the address of the Kubernetes LB. Previously it would resolve the hostname to 1 IP. The `-resolve-hostnames` flag was added to preserve the IP resolution behavior. [[GH-271](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/271)]

IMPROVEMENTS:

* Sync: Add `-sync-lb-services-endpoints` flag to optionally sync load balancer endpoint IPs instead of load balancer ingress IP or hostname to Consul [[GH-257](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/257)].
* Connect: Add pod name to the consul connect metadata for connect injected pods. [[GH-231](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/231)]

BUG FIXES:

* Connect:
    * Fix bug where preStop hook was malformed. This caused Consul ACL tokens to never be deleted for connect services. [[GH-265](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/265)]
    * Fix bug where environment variable for upstream was not populated when using a different datacenter resulted. [[GH-246](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/246)]
    * Fix bug where the Connect health-check was defined with a service name instead of a service ID. This check was passing in consul version before 1.8, but will now fail with versions 1.8 and higher. [[GH-272](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/272)]

## 0.15.0 (May 13, 2020)

BREAKING CHANGES:

* The `service-address` command now resolves load balancer hostnames to the
  first IP. Previously it would use the hostname directly.
  This is a stop-gap measure because Consul currently only supports
  IP addresses for mesh gateways. [[GH-260](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/260)]

FEATURES:

* Add new `create-federation-secret` command that will create a Kubernetes secret
  containing data needed for secondary datacenters to federate. This command should be run only in the primary datacenter. [[GH-253](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/253)]

## 0.14.0 (April 23, 2020)

BREAKING CHANGES:

* ACLs: Remove `-expected-replicas`, `-release-name`, and `-server-label-selector` flags
  in favor of the new required `-server-address` flag [[GH-238](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/238)].

FEATURES:

* ACLs: The `server-acl-init` command can now run against Consul servers running outside of k8s [[GH-243](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/243)]:
  * Add `-bootstrap-token-file` flag to provide your own bootstrap token. If set, the command will
    skip ACL bootstrapping.
  * `-server-address` flag can also take a [cloud auto-join](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/cloud-auto-join.html)
    string to discover server addresses.
  * Add `-inject-auth-method-host` flag to allow configuring the location of the Kubernetes API server
    for the Kubernetes auth method. This is useful because during the login workflow
    Consul servers are talking to the Kubernetes API to verify the service account token.
    When Consul servers are external to the Kubernetes cluster,
    we no longer know the address of the Kubernetes API server that is accessible
    from the external Consul servers.

IMPROVEMENTS:

* ACLs: Add `-server-address` and `-server-port` flags
  so that we don't need to discover server pod IPs and ports through the Kubernetes API [[GH-238](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/238)].

BUG FIXES:

* Connect: Fix upstream annotation parsing when multiple prepared queries are separated by spaces [[GH-224](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/224)]
* ACLs: Fix bug with `acl-init -token-sink-file` where running the command twice would fail [[GH-248](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/248)]

## 0.13.0 (April 06, 2020)

FEATURES:

* ACLs: Support new flag `server-acl-init -create-acl-replication-token` that creates
  an ACL token with permissions to perform ACL replication. [[GH-210](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/210)]
* ACLs: Support ACL replication from another datacenter. If `-acl-replication-token-file`
  is set, the `server-acl-init` command will skip ACL bootstrapping and instead
  will use the token in that file to create policies and tokens. This enables
  the `server-acl-init` command to be run in secondary datacenters. [[GH-226](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/226)]
* ACLs: Support new flag `acl-init -token-sink-file` that will write the token
  to the specified file. [[GH-232](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/232)]
* Commands: Add new command `service-address` that writes the address of the
  specified Kubernetes service to a file. If the service is of type `LoadBalancer`,
  the command will wait until the external address of the load balancer has
  been assigned. If the service is of type `ClusterIP` it will write the cluster
  IP. Services of type `NodePort` or `ExternalName` will result in an error.
  [[GH-234](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/234) and [GH-235](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/235)]
  
  Example usage:
  
      consul-k8s service-address \
        -k8s-namespace=default \
        -name=consul-mesh-gateway \
        -output-file=address.txt

* Commands: Add new `get-consul-client-ca` command that retrieves Consul clients' CA when auto-encrypt is enabled
  and writes it to a file [[GH-211](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/211)].

IMPROVEMENTS:

* ACLs: The following ACL tokens have been changed to local tokens rather than
  global tokens because they only need to be valid in their local datacenter:
  `client`, `enterprise-license`, `snapshot-agent`. In addition, if Consul
  Enterprise namespaces are not enabled, the `catalog-sync` token will be local. [[GH-226](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/226)]
* ACLs: If running with `-create-acl-replication-token=true` and `-create-inject-auth-method=true`,
  the anonymous policy will be configured to allow read access to all nodes and
  services. This is required for cross-datacenter Consul Connect requests to
  work. [[GH-230](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/230)].
* ACLs: The policy for the anonymous token has been renamed from `dns-policy` to `anonymous-token-policy`
  since it is used for more than DNS now (see above). [[GH-230](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/230)].

BUG FIXES:

* Sync: Fix a race condition where sync would delete services at initial startup [[GH-208](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/208)]

DEPRECATIONS:

* ACLs: The flag `-init-type=sync` for the command `acl-init` has been deprecated.
  Only the flag `-init-type=client` is supported. Previously, setting `-init-type=sync`
  had no effect so this is not a breaking change. [[GH-232](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/232)]
* Connect: deprecate the `-consul-ca-cert` flag in favor of `-ca-file` [[GH-217](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/217)]

## 0.12.0 (February 21, 2020)

BREAKING CHANGES:

* Connect Injector
  * Previously the injector would inject sidecars into pods in all namespaces. New flags `-allow-k8s-namespace` and `-deny-k8s-namespace` have been added. If no `-allow-k8s-namespace` flag is specified, the injector **will not inject sidecars into pods in any namespace**. To maintain the previous behavior, set `-allow-k8s-namespace='*'`.
* Catalog Sync
  * `kube-system` and `kube-public` namespaces are now synced from **unless** `-deny-k8s-namespace=kube-system -deny-k8s-namespace=kube-public` are passed to the `sync-catalog` command.
  * Previously, multiple sync processes could be run in the same Kubernetes cluster with different source Kubernetes namespaces and the same `-consul-k8s-tag`. This is no longer possible.
  The sync processes will now delete one-another's registrations. To continue running multiple sync processes, each process must be passed a different `-consul-k8s-tag` flag.
  * Previously, catalog sync would delete services tagged with `-consul-k8s-tag` (defaults to `k8s`) that were registered out-of-band, i.e. not by the sync process itself. It would delete services regardless of which node they were registered on.
  Now the sync process will only delete those services not registered by itself if they are on the `k8s-sync` node (the synthetic node created by the catalog sync process).

* Connect and Mesh Gateways: Consul 1.7+ now requires that we pass `-envoy-version` flag if using a version other than the default (1.13.0) so that it can generate correct bootstrap configuration. This is not yet supported in the Helm chart and consul-k8s, and as such, we require Envoy version 1.13.0.

IMPROVEMENTS:

* Support [**Consul namespaces [Enterprise feature]**](https://www.consul.io/docs/enterprise/namespaces/index.html) in all consul-k8s components [[GH-197](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/197)]
* Create allow and deny lists of k8s namespaces for catalog sync and Connect inject
* Connect Inject
  * Changes default Consul Docker image (`-consul-image`) to `consul:1.7.1`
  * Changes default Envoy Docker image (`-envoy-image`) to `envoyproxy/envoy-alpine:v1.13.0`

BUG FIXES:

* Bootstrap ACLs: Allow users to update their Connect ACL binding rule definition on upgrade
* Bootstrap ACLs: Fixes mesh gateway ACL policies to have the correct permissions
* Sync: Fixes a hot loop bug when getting an error from Consul when retrieving service information [[GH-204](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/204)]

DEPRECATIONS:
* `connect-inject` flag `-create-inject-token` is deprecated in favor of new flag `-create-inject-auth-method`

NOTES:

* Bootstrap ACLs: Previously, ACL policies were not updated after creation. Now, if namespaces are enabled, they are updated every time the ACL bootstrapper is run so that any namespace config changes can be adjusted. This change is only an issue if you are updating ACL policies after creation.

* Connect: Adds additional parsing of the upstream annotation to support namespaces. The format of the annotation becomes:

    `service_name.optional_namespace:port:optional_datacenter`

  The `service_name.namespace` is only parsed if namespaces are enabled. If they are not enabled and someone has added a `.namespace`, the upstream will not work correctly, as is the case when someone has put in an incorrect service name, port or datacenter. If namespaces are enabled and the `.namespace` is not defined, Consul will automatically fallback to assuming the service is in the same namespace as the service defining the upstream.


## 0.11.0 (January 10, 2020)

Improvements:

* Connect: Add TLS support [[GH-181](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/181)].
* Bootstrap ACLs: Add TLS support [[GH-183](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/183)].

Notes:

* Build: Our darwin releases for this version and up will be signed and notarized according to Apple's requirements.
Prior to this release, MacOS 10.15+ users attempting to run our software may see the error: "'consul-k8s' cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified." This error affected all MacOS 10.15+ users who downloaded our software directly via web browsers, and was caused by changes to Apple's third-party software requirements.

  MacOS 10.15+ users should plan to upgrade to 0.11.0+.
* Build: ARM release binaries: Starting with 0.11.0, `consul-k8s` will ship three separate versions of ARM builds. The previous ARM binaries of Consul could potentially crash due to the way the Go runtime manages internal pointers to its Go routine management constructs and how it keeps track of them especially during signal handling (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/32912). From 0.11.0 forward, it is recommended to use:

  consul-k8s\_{version}\_linux_armelv5.zip for all 32-bit armel systems
  consul-k8s\_{version}\_linux_armhfv6.zip for all armhf systems with v6+ architecture
  consul-k8s\_{version}\_linux_arm64.zip for all v8 64-bit architectures
* Build: The `freebsd_arm` variant has been removed.


## 0.10.1 (December 17, 2019)

Bug Fixes:

* Connect: Fix bug where the new lifecycle sidecar didn't have permissions to
  read the ACL token file. [[GH-182](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/182)]

## 0.10.0 (December 17, 2019)

Bug Fixes:

* Connect: Fix critical bug where Connect-registered services instances would be deregistered
  when the Consul client on the same node was restarted. This fix adds a new
  sidecar that ensures the service instance is always registered. [[GH-161](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/161)]

* Connect: Fix bug where UI links between sidecar and service didn't work because
  the wrong service ID was being used. [[GH-163](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/163)]

* Bootstrap ACLs: Support bootstrapACLs for users setting the `nameOverride` config. [[GH-165](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/165)]

## 0.9.5 (December 5, 2019)

Bug Fixes:

* Sync: Add Kubernetes namespace as a suffix
  to the service names via `-add-k8s-namespace-suffix` flag.
  This prevents service name collisions in Consul when there
  are two services with the same name in different
  namespaces in Kubernetes [[GH-139](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/139)]

* Connect: Only write a `service-defaults` config during Connect injection if
  the protocol is set explicitly [[GH-169](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/169)]

## 0.9.4 (October 28, 2019)

Bug Fixes:

* Sync: Now changing the annotation `consul.hashicorp.com/service-sync` to `false`
  or deleting the annotation will un-sync the service. [[GH-76](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/76)]

* Sync: Rewrite Consul services to lowercase so they're valid Kubernetes services.
  [[GH-110](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/110)]

## 0.9.3 (October 15, 2019)

Bug Fixes:

* Add new delete-completed-job command that is used to delete the
  server-acl-init Kubernetes Job once it's completed. [[GH-152](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/152)]

* Fixes a bug where even if the ACL Tokens for the other components existed
  (e.g. client or sync-catalog) we'd try to generate new tokens and update the secrets. [[GH-152](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/152)]

## 0.9.2 (October 4, 2019)

Improvements:

* Allow users to set annotations on their Kubernetes services that get synced into
  Consul meta when using the Connect Inject functionality.
  To use, set one or more `consul.hashicorp.com/service-meta-<key>: <value>` annotations
  which will result in Consul meta `<key>: <value>`
  [[GH-141](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/141)]

Bug Fixes:

* Fix bug during connect-inject where the `-default-protocol` flag was being
  ignored [[GH-141](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/141)]

* Fix bug during connect-inject where service-tag annotations were
  being ignored [[GH-141](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/141)]

* Fix bug during `server-acl-init` where if any step errored then the command
  would exit and subsequent commands would fail. Now this command runs until
  completion, i.e. it retries failed steps indefinitely and is idempotent
  [[GH-138](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/138)]

Deprecations:

* The `consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-tags` annotation is deprecated.
  Use `consul.hashicorp.com/service-tags` instead.

## 0.9.1 (September 18, 2019)

Improvements:

* Allow users to set tags on their Kubernetes services that get synced into
  Consul service tags via the `consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-tags`
  annotation [[GH-115](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/115)]

Bug fixes:

* Fix bootstrap acl issue when Consul was installed into a namespace other than `default`
  [[GH-106](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/106)]
* Fix sync bug where `ClusterIP` services had their `Service` port instead
  of their `Endpoint` port registered. If the `Service`'s `targetPort` was different
  then `port` then the wrong port would be registered [[GH-132](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/132)]

## 0.8.1 (May 9, 2019)

Bug fixes:

* Fix central configuration write command to handle the case where the service already exists

## 0.8.0 (May 8, 2019)

Improvements:

* Use the endpoint IP address when generating a service id for NodePort services to prevent possible overlap of what are supposed to be unique ids

## 0.7.0 (March 21, 2019)

Improvements:

* Use service's namespace when registering endpoints
* Update the Coalesce method to pass go vet tests
* Register Connect services along with the proxy. This allows the services to appear in the intention dropdown in the UI.[[GH 77](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-helm/issues/77)]
* Add `-log-level` CLI flag for catalog sync

## 0.6.0 (February 22, 2019)

Bug fixes:

* Fix service registration naming when using Connect [[GH 36](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/36)]
* Fix catalog sync so that agents don't incorrectly deregister Kubernetes services [[GH 40](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/40)][[GH 59](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/59)]
* Fix performance issue for the k8s -> Consul catalog sync [[GH 60](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/60)]

Bug fixes:

* Register NodePort services with the node's ip address [[GH 8](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/8)]
* Add the metadata/annotations field if needed before patching annotations [[GH 20](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/20)]

## 0.3.0 (December 7, 2018)
Improvements:

* Support syncing ClusterIP services [[GH 4](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/4)]

  automatic Connect sidecar injection in Kubernetes. While this can be setup
  manually, we recommend using the Consul helm chart.

## 0.1.0 (September 26, 2018)

* Initial release
