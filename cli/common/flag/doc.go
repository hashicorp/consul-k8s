// Package flag is a thin layer over the stdlib flag package that provides
// some minimal features such as aliasing, autocompletion handling, improved
// defaults, etc. It was created for mitchellh/cli but can work as a standalone
// package. Source: https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/tree/348d2c77fce199952618ccef6433c8844b22583b/internal/pkg/flag, or release tag 0.5.1.
